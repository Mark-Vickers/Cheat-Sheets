# Minimal Python Script
The following is a really minimal python script. All it demonstrates is defining a function and detecting that we are the main script running.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

# simple example python script

def afunction():
    print("[+] afunction called")

if __name__ == "__main__":

    print("[+] script started")
    afunction()
    print("[+] script finished")
```
