# Cheat-Sheets
A collection of cheat sheets for languages, scripts, definition files and others.

I'm starting with extremely simple stuff. Just the extreme basics. As time goes on the cheat sheets will show more advanced topics and styles.

These files will become my aide memoire as I switch from language to language. Sometimes you forget the simple stuff when you've been working in one language or set of langauges for a while and need something to look at to get your brain back on the right page!
